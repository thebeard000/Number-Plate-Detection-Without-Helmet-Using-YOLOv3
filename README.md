# Number-Plate-Detection-Without-Helmet-Using-YOLOv3
This Git repository houses a project focused on real-time traffic violation detection. By employing YOLOv3 and Python-based CNN, it identifies helmetless riders and improperly displayed number plates using existing surveillance cameras. The aim is to aid law enforcement in swiftly identifying violators, reducing reliance on dedicated ANPR cameras."

## About the Project

The **Number Plate Detection Without Helmet Using YOLOv3** project addresses the need for an efficient and cost-effective solution to detect and enforce traffic violations related to helmetless riders and improperly displayed number plates. By leveraging existing surveillance cameras and advanced computer vision techniques, the system provides real-time monitoring and violation detection, reducing the reliance on dedicated Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras. This project aims to provide law enforcement agencies with an effective tool to identify vehicles involved in traffic violations quickly.

## Project Details

- **YOLOv3 Algorithm**: The system utilizes the YOLOv3 algorithm for real-time object detection.
- **CNN Model**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented in Python for efficient and real-time detection of number plates in various traffic conditions.
- **OCR**: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using pytesseract for extracting characters from number plates.

## Key Features

- Real-time detection of helmetless riders.
- Real-time detection of improperly displayed number plates.
- Utilizes YOLOv3 and CNN for efficient detection.
- Reduces costs by leveraging existing surveillance cameras.
- Integrates with open-source software for image processing and license plate recognition.
